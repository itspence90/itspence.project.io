Project Webpage 1 - Zero to Mastery

This project was started from the Udemy course The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery.

I will be editing this project myself and publishing my edits as I go.

PIECES OF THE PUZZLE

All pieces of the page started out as smaller buttons with their respective words in them defining what they're supposed to be turned into.

Header - This is obvious; the object is to be turned into a header.

Cover - This is the section that follows the header. With this project I could turn this into nearly anything. I'm thinking of a carousel with bootstrap or even stretch it
out more and make it into a section with paragraphs and alternating pictures.

Project Grid - The Project Grid section is to be turned into a grid using CSS Grid coding. The IMG folder contains images I could use for this section.

Footer - Again, quite obvious. The trouble I'll have is what to put in the footer.
